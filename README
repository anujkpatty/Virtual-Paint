_must have webcam on computer!_

instructions:\
simply run the file and a window will open showing
a live feed of your webcam. using any small RED object,
move it around the screen to draw. you can change the color
using the number keys or using the color sliders,
clear the screen by pressing 'c', 
pause the drawing by pressing space, and quit the 
program by pressing 'q'. if the program is having
difficulty locating your red object, try adjusting
the lighting in the room or using a different object.
for testing i used a red marker cap.
the color masking values can be adjusted on line 96
and 97 if needed.
